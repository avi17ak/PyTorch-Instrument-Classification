# PyTorch-Instrument-Classification

Musical instruments produce distinct sounds, each with unique tonal qualities. Traditional classification relies on manual analysis, but deep learning enables automated recognition based on audio features.

This tutorial explores how to classify instrument sounds using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in PyTorch. We use the NSynth dataset, which contains thousands of notes played by different instruments, and convert these audio files into Mel spectrogramsâ€”visual representations of sound. By training a CNN, we analyse how instruments differ in their frequency patterns. This tutorial covers data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation, demonstrating how AI can enhance music analysis.
